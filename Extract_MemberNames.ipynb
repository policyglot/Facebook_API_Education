However, life in the beginning was not same like he has now. \\n\\nMr.Keetheswaran belong to a very poor family from Tamil Nadu in Chennai. His father, Shankar  is a Mechanic and was the only earning member in the family. Mr.Keetheswaran and his whole family depended on whatever meager amount his father could earn from the Mechanic Shop they have. Gradually, with the strain in the financial income he had to give his studies and was looking out for a job to help his father. It was during the days of search when he came across Don Bosco Vazhikatti,perambur and learned about the free training they provided to youth like him. He let no time to waste and got enrolled the very next day after he successfully insisted his parents to let him take the training. With lots of hope and faith, he joined Dbtech as a Retail trainee under Quest Alliance.\\n\\nDuring the initial days, Keetheswaran struggled to catch the training program and brush his skills for his benefits. The struggle he came across was taken as a challenge which he overcomes at the end of the three month training. He came out with a flying color and positive changes in his behavior and attitude. After the training, he got a campus placement in a News channel called Captain News Channel as a Editor with a salary of Rs. 15,500 per month. \\n\\nAs he felt that he needs to grow more in his career, he joined Cauvery News Channel as a Editor and later promoted to Senior Editor. At present he is working as a Senior editor in Cauvery News Channel. He is very happy and contented with his job. Appreciating the humanitarian work of Don Bosco Vazhikatti and Quest alliance he says, “I am able to earn my livelihood and help to my family now. This all happened because Don Bosco Vazhikatti nd quest alliance came into my life. I would like to thanks the centre, my trainers and More for giving me this opportunity and to carve out a way to a better future for me and my family.',\n",

       " {'message': \"Thank you all for attending the Masterclass on Basics of Digital literacy. For those who could not make it, here is a summary of the Masterclass for your reference and learning: \\n\\n**Part 1: Why is Digital Literacy important? **\\n\\nIt is a literacy just like reading and writing and is a must in today’s world.\\n\\nThe more we use technology to meet our needs and requirements, the more we need to build our capacity to use it well. It is not just about keeping up to date with technology, but if we also want to be productive and successful in our workplaces, then we need to be digitally literate. \\n\\n**What does Digital Literacy mean?  **\\n\\nIt is the ability to find, evaluate, create, use and share information using digital technology and Internet. \\n\\n**As trainers, how do we use technology as a tool to learn and not allow it to become a barrier for learning? **\\n\\nUse technology in your sessions either in your teaching process or allow answers to be given using smart phones since once students graduate from your centre/ITI and look for work or go for higher studies, they will need to look for solutions/information. \\n\\n**Part 2 : Tips for finding information on the internet  **\\n\\nTip 1. Use keyword  - a single or multiple words that are key(very important) for your search. For ex, you can search for:  Rasgulla shops on M G Road Bangalore \\n\\nTip 2: Use double quotes when you are new to a certain topic or subject that you need information on. \\n\\nFor ex, “Retail Management” will search for both Retail and management together\\n\\nTip 3: You can also try out advanced google search for finding information (https://www.google.com/advanced_search)\\n\\nTip 4: Be more specific in your search. For ex, search for “outdoor energizer for a group of 30 youth” instead of just “energizer for a group of 30” makes your search more specific and accurate. \\n\\n**Evaluating information on the internet: **\\n\\nIt is equally important to evaluate information that we find on the internet. Wikipedia is a decently reliable source of information. The references at the bottom of a Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.org/) page lists the various sources of information for the content of a particular webpage on the Wikipedia. \\n\\nNo matter what type of research you're doing, it's important to look at multiple sources. Even a reliable website may not include all of the relevant information. Using multiple sources allows you to see all sides of a story, which gives you a better perspective than if you had only looked at one source. \\n\\nAn excellent article to help you evaluate information: https://www.gcflearnfree.org/searchbetter/judging-online-information/1/\\n\\nBoth finding and evaluating information are skills that get better with practice.  ***So go out there and practice, practice and practice. ***\\n\\n**Part 3: What is Internet? **\\n\\nIt is a huge network of digital devices such as smart phones, desktop computers, laptops etc that communicate with each other. It is built using cables running all across the planet. It was started for defense purposes but today it is equally accessible for everyone, including children who use it for learning new subjects. \\n\\n**Creating and sharing information: **\\n\\nWe are becoming creators of media and sharing media across platforms such as Facebook and Trainer tribe which uses Workplace from Facebook. You can create and share audios, videos, pictures, articles etc related to your trainings/subject on Trainer tribe just like you would share on Facebook. You can also share resources shared on Trainer tribe in your classrooms or with your colleagues who are not yet on Trainer Tribe. \\n\\n**Quest’s work on Digital Literacy: **\\n\\nQuest uses the blended learning model for training of trainers. Quest has its own Digital literacy handbook. It’s digital toolkit for trainers is currently under production and will be rolled out in the near future. Quest also has a digital toolkit on programming concepts which can be made available if required. \\n\\n**Part 4: We are happy to help you: **\\n\\nFor any queries related to Digital literacy if you would like to simple attend a session on Digital literacy conducted by the Quest team, please feel free to post your question in either of the following ways: \\n\\n1. Place your question in the Digital literacy group\\n\\n2. Post a message to any of the Digital literacy team members namely Aditi Kumar , Pavani , Anitha, Nikhil Patel  on Trainer Tribe. \\n\\n3. You may also send an email to trainertribe@questalliance.net or send a message to the Trainer tribe account.\",\n",

All you have to do is sit there and hear what the other person is saying, occasionally nod your head and pay lip service, right. After all, you have so many other urgent tasks to be getting on with and can't give your full attention.\\n\\nBut you also know what it's like when someone else is not really listening to you. It can make you feel irritated and even unimportant, can't it?\\n\\nYou see, good listening requires active participation in the conversation, and the good news is that you can improve your skills by learning how to listen effectively, and then practising at work and at home too. \\n\\nAs you improve your listening skills, you'll enjoy several important benefits:\\n\\n1. You'll become more employable and also find it easier to learn. Employers really value good listening skills because of all the benefits they bring to an organization.\\n\\n2. It is likely to improve all your personal relationships, both at home and at work;\\n\\n3.

But how important is the eLearning team behind eLearning courses, and what characteristics does it need to embody?*\\n\\n## **Top Traits A Successful eLearning Team Should Have**\\n\\neLearning teams come in all shapes and sizes, depending on the scope of the eLearning course. The dynamics of an [**eLearning team**](https://elearningindustry.com/tags/elearning-team) also depend on budgetary restrictions. However, certain key elements are non-negotiable when you’re gathering eLearning collaborators. The members of your eLearning team need to be on the same page and speak the same language to lead to eLearning course success. They may have different paths and tactics, but they need to be headed in the same direction. In short, they must all have the same vision for the eLearning course to produce high quality eLearning content.\\n\\n[**GET THE FREE EBOOK](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/elearning-project-management-and-planning-top-tips)Get a Free PDF Download on eLearning Project Management.**This Free eBook can help you learn all the characteristics of a successful eLearning Project Manager.\\n## **1. Clear Hierarchy Of Tasks**\\n\\nIn the modern world, flat leadership systems and open-plan workspaces are all the rage. The idea is that every team member is on the same level. There are no corner offices or opportunities to pull rank. Every team member has an equal say. That’s all well and good, but when it comes to eLearning there needs to be an effective chain of command. In order for the eLearning course to be developed efficiently and effectively, there must be a clear division of tasks. Everyone should know who is in charge of specific [**eLearning challenges**](https://elearningindustry.com/5-common-elearning-challenges-overcome). It’s also important to know who has the final say on important decisions like eLearning course design, upgrades, and eLearning course material. It’s a key facet of quality control.\\n## **2. Strong Team Ethics**\\n\\nThe eLearning development machine consists of a number of moving parts, and they all need to run smoothly. You must think about the eLearning course design and breakdown of eLearning content. Tone is important, and so is layout. There are hundreds of tiny decisions to make throughout the eLearning course development process. Often, these decisions are made concurrently, and one choice may interfere with another. For example, the [**graphic designer**](https://elearningindustry.com/role-graphic-designer-elearning-team) might make a color choice that is not in accordance to the design document approved by the client. Because of all the tiny interdependent cogs involved in eLearning course development, [**teamwork**](https://elearningindustry.com/5-ways-to-develop-teamwork-skills-in-online-training) is the biggest defining bond. It holds everything together and ensures optimal work flow.\\n## **3. Diversified Strengths**\\n\\nWe’ve already highlighted some of the task segments involved in putting together an eLearning course. A lot of them might be taken for granted but they are all essential to the final product. You know that you need a top-notch eLearning content author to write eLearning content and a brilliant [**Instructional Designer**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/how-to-kick-start-and-boost-an-amazing-instructional-design-career) to structure the eLearning content in a learner-friendly manner. You need a graphic designer to make it pretty, and at least one eLearning developer dedicated to testing eLearning content to check for bugs. Each of these roles are filled by an expert in their field. You should take the time to identify the key strengths of your collaborators and then assign tasks accordingly.\\n## **4. Effective eLearning Project Management**\\n\\nWhen you have so many creative people working together, tempers can flare and styles can clash. A good eLearning Project Manager will help all the different elements fit together. They also help to maintain timelines and resolve conflicts, as well as spot any hold-ups in the system and find a way to work past them. The [**eLearning Project Manager**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/elearning-project-management-and-planning-top-tips) has the duty of keeping everyone motivated. They need good communication skills and the ability to work well with others. The role of an eLearning Project Manager stretches into quality control, as well. They will monitor progress and tweak the system as necessary for optimal results.\\n## **5. eLearning Course Development Guidelines**\\n\\nThe content of any eLearning course has several subsets. The [**Instructional Designer**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/how-to-become-instructional-designer), with the help of a [**Subject Matter Expert**](https://elearningindustry.com/7-tips-find-right-subject-matter-expert-elearning-project), decides what the eLearning course is about and what exactly will go into it. They decide what topics will be taught, how many modules there will be, and how it will be broken down. Then an eLearning content author takes all that course material and puts it in written form. They write the actual text that will go into the eLearning course, as well as the script for the narrative sections. After that's wrapped up, the Instructional Designer reviews the eLearning content to ensure that it’s clear and concise. A storyboard is developed, and eLearning developers create and test the eLearning course based on it. This is teamwork. Everyone needs to be able to follow pre-determined eLearning course development guidelines to stay on track. This process also upholds the continuity of the eLearning content so that online learners receive a cohesive eLearning course that's fragment-free.\\n## **6. Purpose-Driven Visual Design**\\n\\nVisual design handles the final look and feel of the eLearning course. It covers illustrations and graphics, but it also deals with page layout, choice of color, and font type. The graphic design team may include photographers, sketch artists, graphic designers, and even web developers. Especially, in the case of [**gamification**](https://elearningindustry.com/tags/gamification-examples), visual design is very important because it’s the first thing online learners notice about an eLearning course. Besides [**setting the right tone**](https://elearningindustry.com/tips-choose-right-tone-for-elearning), it can inspire, encourage, or demoralize an online learner. A strong visual design team is the basis of any eLearning course.\\n\\neLearning teams cover a wide range of expertise, and each area of expertise is essential to the success of the eLearning course. Mandatory team members include Instructional Designers, eLearning content developers, graphic artists, eLearning course developers, QA testers, and administrative personnel, under the supervision of an [**eLearning Project Manager**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/elearning-project-management-and-planning-top-tips), who is the go-to person in any particular situation. These team members need to work together to facilitate the smooth flow of the eLearning project.\\n\\nWant to learn more top tips on how to improve collaboration in eLearning Projects?
