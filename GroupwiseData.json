Gottlieb said this research would greatly increase your chances of success, because most companies have made common mistakes that have led to their demise. He said that having the humility to learn from the mistakes of others before making them yourself is the secret to success.\n\n**Make sure this is what you want.** Because entrepreneurship entails so much hard work, it is critical to ensure you're following the right path,\n\n\"If this is something you really want, then think long term, and be persistent,\" she said. \"The vast majority of great entrepreneurs failed multiple times before they finally found the business idea that took off and brought them success.\"\n\n**Solve problems.** Entrepreneurs should always be in search of problems to solve and not the other way around, . In other words, \"they should not start with a solution looking for a problem,\" he said.\n\n**Be passionate.** Successful entrepreneurs are driven primarily by a need for achievement and the desire to make a meaningful difference, Bachenheimer said. \"The most important traits are passion and persistence, but these must not be confused with arrogance and stubbornness,\" he said.\n\n**Get advice from those who have done it.**  business owners to find mentors who are successful, in addition to reading books, networking with people they admire and looking into great education programs to help them throughout the process.",
