# This tip could be related to their classroom training experience or the toolkit they teach - it is something that they feel confident about and works for them almost if not every time they try it out! 
# This week, we feature Melvin, one of our facilitators at Quest. Watch the video to know his tip and let us know your thoughts as well!!

One of the main objective  of  this session was ""to create an understanding about health and awareness  about menstruation cycle.""

**Topics were-: **

1.Health,its importance and factors affecting health

2. Nutrition, deficiency of nutrition and Balanced diet

3. An important topic was also covered with the context of women/girls, that was about  the **anemia, menstruation cycle, hygiene during periods and myths about periods in our society. ** 

**Feedback from students-: ** Before  this session I tried to talk about this with girls and I got to know that they are unaware about the menstruation cycle, why it happen with them/only with girls. That time I also found hesitation in them. some of them started smiling.   

After the session girls said that they got to know about their  body, importance and process of menstruation cycle, hygiene during periods time & myths about periods in our society.

1.  (aaj se phle itna apne shareer ke bare me nhi janti thi jo aaj class me jan ne ko mila)

2.Gender ke bare me janko mila jo hame pata hona chahiye.

I am pavani,I have conducted guest lecture on career building and importance of communicative english at Maulana Azad national Urdu university in Hyderabad

would like to share notes of guest lecture

 

About Speaker: Avishek Gupta, Head of Business
Avishek leads the Business team at CII and identifies new investment opportunities and manages investments across Caspian's focus sectors.
[https://www.cii.caspian.in/avishek](https://www.cii.caspian.in/avishek)

Main points he discussed:
1.Career Building
2.Importance of communicative English

On Career, what worked
1.keep an open mind
2.Work hard on whatever opportunity you get
3.Keep learning
4.Get ahead in career by pushing yourself ahead and not by pushing others behind
5.Build relationships and trust with other people
6.Be on Time

On English:

There are about 1600 languages in India and 22+1 officially recognised languages. How do you communicate with another set of people who come from a different set?
English is the most commonly spoken language across most of the world and even in India. If you want to get work done, if you want others to help you, if you want to learn, the only way to do that is make it easier for larger number of people to understand what you are saying and help you. English is the single most widely spoken language and hence you have a better chance of being able to reach out to a much wider set of people by being able to converse in English

Students feedback:
Session was very helpful to how they can build their career by the different opportunities and options they can choose.
Expecting more sessions on
1.Tme management
2.Employability
3.Job opportunities",Pavani,2018-04-18T06:12:30+0000

# ***The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by R. Stephen Covey ***

It is rightly said that **habits make or break a man**. If you want to know **why you are not doing something right,** sometimes all you need is to perform an analysis of your habits and consider altering them. 

The book aims at providing its readers with** the importance of character ethics and personality ethics.** The author talks about the*** values of integrity, courage, a sense of justice and most importantly, honesty.*** The book is a discussion about the** seven most essential habits that every individual must adopt **to in order to live a life which is more fulfilling.

I am **open to your Questions** for Discussions.

 Domain         : Retail 
 Employer      : Cauvery News Channel 
 Designation   : Senior Editor 

  

Mr.Keetheswaran, at present, is working in Cauvery News Channel as a Senior Editor  in Chennai with a monthly salary of Rs 20,000/- per month. However, life in the beginning was not same like he has now. 

Mr.Keetheswaran belong to a very poor family from Tamil Nadu in Chennai. His father, Shankar  is a Mechanic and was the only earning member in the family. Mr.Keetheswaran and his whole family depended on whatever meager amount his father could earn from the Mechanic Shop they have. Gradually, with the strain in the financial income he had to give his studies and was looking out for a job to help his father. It was during the days of search when he came across Don Bosco Vazhikatti,perambur and learned about the free training they provided to youth like him. He let no time to waste and got enrolled the very next day after he successfully insisted his parents to let him take the training. With lots of hope and faith, he joined Dbtech as a Retail trainee under Quest Alliance.

During the initial days, Keetheswaran struggled to catch the training program and brush his skills for his benefits. The struggle he came across was taken as a challenge which he overcomes at the end of the three month training. He came out with a flying color and positive changes in his behavior and attitude. After the training, he got a campus placement in a News channel called Captain News Channel as a Editor with a salary of Rs. 15,500 per month. 

As he felt that he needs to grow more in his career, he joined Cauvery News Channel as a Editor and later promoted to Senior Editor. At present he is working as a Senior editor in Cauvery News Channel. He is very happy and contented with his job. Appreciating the humanitarian work of Don Bosco Vazhikatti and Quest alliance he says, “I am able to earn my livelihood and help to my family now. This all happened because Don Bosco Vazhikatti nd quest alliance came into my life. I would like to thanks the centre, my trainers and More for giving me this opportunity and to carve out a way to a better future for me and my family.",Sundar karnan,2018-03-13T10:03:39+0000

**Part 1: Why is Digital Literacy important? **

It is a literacy just like reading and writing and is a must in today’s world.

The more we use technology to meet our needs and requirements, the more we need to build our capacity to use it well. It is not just about keeping up to date with technology, but if we also want to be productive and successful in our workplaces, then we need to be digitally literate. 

**What does Digital Literacy mean?  **

It is the ability to find, evaluate, create, use and share information using digital technology and Internet. 

**As trainers, how do we use technology as a tool to learn and not allow it to become a barrier for learning? **

Use technology in your sessions either in your teaching process or allow answers to be given using smart phones since once students graduate from your centre/ITI and look for work or go for higher studies, they will need to look for solutions/information. 

**Part 2 : Tips for finding information on the internet  **

Tip 1. Use keyword  - a single or multiple words that are key(very important) for your search. For ex, you can search for:  Rasgulla shops on M G Road Bangalore 

Tip 2: Use double quotes when you are new to a certain topic or subject that you need information on. 

For ex, “Retail Management” will search for both Retail and management together

Tip 3: You can also try out advanced google search for finding information (https://www.google.com/advanced_search)

Tip 4: Be more specific in your search. For ex, search for “outdoor energizer for a group of 30 youth” instead of just “energizer for a group of 30” makes your search more specific and accurate. 

**Evaluating information on the internet: **

It is equally important to evaluate information that we find on the internet. Wikipedia is a decently reliable source of information. The references at the bottom of a Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.org/) page lists the various sources of information for the content of a particular webpage on the Wikipedia. 

No matter what type of research you're doing, it's important to look at multiple sources. Even a reliable website may not include all of the relevant information. Using multiple sources allows you to see all sides of a story, which gives you a better perspective than if you had only looked at one source. 

An excellent article to help you evaluate information: https://www.gcflearnfree.org/searchbetter/judging-online-information/1/

Both finding and evaluating information are skills that get better with practice.  ***So go out there and practice, practice and practice. ***

**Part 3: What is Internet? **

It is a huge network of digital devices such as smart phones, desktop computers, laptops etc that communicate with each other. It is built using cables running all across the planet. It was started for defense purposes but today it is equally accessible for everyone, including children who use it for learning new subjects. 

**Creating and sharing information: **

We are becoming creators of media and sharing media across platforms such as Facebook and Trainer tribe which uses Workplace from Facebook. You can create and share audios, videos, pictures, articles etc related to your trainings/subject on Trainer tribe just like you would share on Facebook. You can also share resources shared on Trainer tribe in your classrooms or with your colleagues who are not yet on Trainer Tribe. 

**Quest’s work on Digital Literacy: **

Quest uses the blended learning model for training of trainers. Quest has its own Digital literacy handbook. It’s digital toolkit for trainers is currently under production and will be rolled out in the near future. Quest also has a digital toolkit on programming concepts which can be made available if required. 

**Part 4: We are happy to help you: **

For any queries related to Digital literacy if you would like to simple attend a session on Digital literacy conducted by the Quest team, please feel free to post your question in either of the following ways: 

1. Place your question in the Digital literacy group

2. Post a message to any of the Digital literacy team members namely Aditi Kumar , Pavani , Anitha, Nikhil Patel  on Trainer Tribe. 

3. You may also send an email to trainertribe@questalliance.net or send a message to the Trainer tribe account.",Trainer Tribe,2018-03-12T12:07:29+0000

# **How To Think Like Leonardo da Vinci**

This is the **summary of the Book**, which only contains **less than 10 Pages**.

You can **learn the Basic concepts** of the book ***within 10 Minutes.***

***Leonardo da Vinci was the ultimate high achiever -- with simultaneous careers as a world-class artist, architect, scientist, inventor and engineer. In his spare time, he was also an accomplished cook and played musical instruments to a professional level. Therefore, if anybody can exemplify how to apply creativity and learning skills productively, da Vinci is the consummate role model.***

The following things are the impact what we want to see among the young adults through skill to succeed programme. 
1. Young adult should map themselves to know their strength, interest, potential, challenges etc.
1. Young adult should have the employable skills
1. Young adult able to chose their career path and start their journey.

To reach this goal we gave an assignment to the fellow trainer to map themselves through complete picture.

In understanding learner we had discussion on the video MAN WITH BAG. the trainer are able to understand how our biased mindset might hamper the learning interest of students. 

We had a group discussion to list out the information about the students we need so that we can understand them better but it has to be voluntarily and they have all the right on privacy too.

We gave an assignment ""know your learner""

We watched all the three videos in the facilitator module, the participants decided that the third is the best approach i.e student centered approach. we also discussed about the limitation of other approach i.e content and teacher centered approach. 

We discussed what is facilitation - Facilitation is to make the people to understand the concept in an easy way with using variety of approach which suits them. 

Finally we also disccussed about the values facilitator should have for an effective learning.

ONCE again thanks to Quest Alliance for providing opportunity through MASTER COACH to learn about the importance of facilitation.",Paul Ramanathan,2018-01-22T04:40:18+0000

Listen Up!

Improving your listening skills

Many people take listening for granted. All you have to do is sit there and hear what the other person is saying, occasionally nod your head and pay lip service, right. After all, you have so many other urgent tasks to be getting on with and can't give your full attention.

But you also know what it's like when someone else is not really listening to you. It can make you feel irritated and even unimportant, can't it?

You see, good listening requires active participation in the conversation, and the good news is that you can improve your skills by learning how to listen effectively, and then practising at work and at home too. 

As you improve your listening skills, you'll enjoy several important benefits:

1. You'll become more employable and also find it easier to learn. Employers really value good listening skills because of all the benefits they bring to an organization.

2. It is likely to improve all your personal relationships, both at home and at work;

3. Speaking raises your blood pressure, but research shows that listening reduces it - good listeners are healthier!

We are launching a pilot in Ahmadabad to provide support services to Alumni to help them when they enter the world of work. To do so, we need to understand the challenges that they face.

Since you interact with students and alumni, you will have first hand information about this. We want to collate all the main challenges faced by Alumni. Based on this, we will roll out support services that will help the Alumni.

I need your help to document these challenges. If you are ready and available, I will follow-up with a phone call, where we can discuss your experiences in detail.

Thank you for your help and support.

* **System 2 has some ability to change** the way **System 1 **works,by programming the normally automatic functions of attention and memory.
* it is **easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own**.
* During a mental multiplication,** the pupil normally dilated to a large size within a few seconds and stayed large as long as the individual kept working **on the problem; **it contracted immediately when she found a solution or gave up**.
* Baumeister ’s group has repeatedly found that an **effort of will or self control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, **you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ***Ego Depletion***.
* The **effects of Ego Depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose,** and Baumeister and his colleagues have confirmed this hypothesis in several experiments.

We all have students of different religions and different casts in our S2S centers and ITIs. We can do this to unite them.

At CEDRA Nadiad center on 18th Oct students came with their lunch box with different varieties; veg, non veg and some fast food. At first they opened their boxes and arranged in the circle and they also stood in front of their  boxes. After instruction music started and with music students started to walk in the circle. ( Like musical chair )After few seconds music stopped and students also stopped where they were. They set down, ate the food which was in front of them. Again music started and students started to  walk. Music stopped. This time different box was in front of them. They set down and ate that food. Some vegetarians exchanged their food. 

In this way all students tested different food and we tried to unite them through this way. After this "" Dabba Party"" all students were very happy. Facilitator also explained "" what was the reason behind this ""Dabba Party"" and they understood the depth.  This is the real Festival Celebration ....

# **Blue Ocean Strategy Vs Red Ocean Strategy**

**Blue ocean strategy** generally refers to the*** creation by a company of a new, uncontested market space*** that makes competitors irrelevant and that **creates new consumer value often while decreasing costs. **

**Red ocean strategy **Here companies try to outperform their** rivals to grab a greater share of product or service demand.** As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities or niche, and cutthroat ***competition turns the ocean bloody;*** hence, the term **""red oceans"".**

That is why I became a private Tutor at my own roof, and visiting the places who invite me.

==================
She's seventy and yet
she's super strong.
TT is her religion 
Thts where she belong.

So she came, one day 
Draped in a beautifulsaree. 
A racket in her hand
Looking ever alive and carefree. 

Standing before the table
Quietly she took her stance. 
People around thought,well,
Lets give her a chance.
 
What followed after 
Is nothing but history,
And what she did there 
Is still a great mystery.

For every coming ball 
She had a perfect shot, 
Her topspins and smashes 
Were simply too hot. 

Frnds we can use this video to motivate ourself and we can keep our learners motivated.If a 70yrs old granny can do the wonder..why can't we create wonders...

 **Chapter - 5 Last Mover Advantages**
# **CHARACTERISTICS OF MONOPOLY**
* For a company **to be valuable it must grow and endure, **but many entrepreneurs focus only on short-term growth. They have an excuse: **growth is easy to measure, but durability isn't.**
* **Every monopoly is unique,** but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: ***Proprietary technology, Network effects, Economies of scale, and Branding.***
* You can radically improve an existing solution: ***once you’re 10x better, you escape competition.*** PayPal, for instance, made buying and selling on eBay at least 10 times better.
* The clearest way **to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. **If you** build something valuable where there was nothing before,** the increase in value is theoretically infinite.

You need not ask them to mention in the world map where a country is located..! but ask them the direction (Indicating the side by index finger) from their standing place where a certain country is located.

Anyway, just have a glance mine.
If you are a native of English, it mightn't be challenge to think ideas in English because it would be your habitual. But if you are a non native, you may listen here.
When you handle English what do you do?
Do you think idea in your tongue and then you transmit? or
Do you think your idea in English itself?
If you do the second, how do you do that?

Because the prob is not in vocabulary or anything else.! But the factor what I said here.
Can a non native think ideas in English?

*There’s a lot of focus on eLearning courses and their ability to boost eLearning ROI. But how important is the eLearning team behind eLearning courses, and what characteristics does it need to embody?*

## **Top Traits A Successful eLearning Team Should Have**

eLearning teams come in all shapes and sizes, depending on the scope of the eLearning course. The dynamics of an [**eLearning team**](https://elearningindustry.com/tags/elearning-team) also depend on budgetary restrictions. However, certain key elements are non-negotiable when you’re gathering eLearning collaborators. The members of your eLearning team need to be on the same page and speak the same language to lead to eLearning course success. They may have different paths and tactics, but they need to be headed in the same direction. In short, they must all have the same vision for the eLearning course to produce high quality eLearning content.

[**GET THE FREE EBOOK](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/elearning-project-management-and-planning-top-tips)Get a Free PDF Download on eLearning Project Management.**This Free eBook can help you learn all the characteristics of a successful eLearning Project Manager.
## **1. Clear Hierarchy Of Tasks**

In the modern world, flat leadership systems and open-plan workspaces are all the rage. The idea is that every team member is on the same level. There are no corner offices or opportunities to pull rank. Every team member has an equal say. That’s all well and good, but when it comes to eLearning there needs to be an effective chain of command. In order for the eLearning course to be developed efficiently and effectively, there must be a clear division of tasks. Everyone should know who is in charge of specific [**eLearning challenges**](https://elearningindustry.com/5-common-elearning-challenges-overcome). It’s also important to know who has the final say on important decisions like eLearning course design, upgrades, and eLearning course material. It’s a key facet of quality control.
## **2. Strong Team Ethics**

The eLearning development machine consists of a number of moving parts, and they all need to run smoothly. You must think about the eLearning course design and breakdown of eLearning content. Tone is important, and so is layout. There are hundreds of tiny decisions to make throughout the eLearning course development process. Often, these decisions are made concurrently, and one choice may interfere with another. For example, the [**graphic designer**](https://elearningindustry.com/role-graphic-designer-elearning-team) might make a color choice that is not in accordance to the design document approved by the client. Because of all the tiny interdependent cogs involved in eLearning course development, [**teamwork**](https://elearningindustry.com/5-ways-to-develop-teamwork-skills-in-online-training) is the biggest defining bond. It holds everything together and ensures optimal work flow.
## **3. Diversified Strengths**

We’ve already highlighted some of the task segments involved in putting together an eLearning course. A lot of them might be taken for granted but they are all essential to the final product. You know that you need a top-notch eLearning content author to write eLearning content and a brilliant [**Instructional Designer**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/how-to-kick-start-and-boost-an-amazing-instructional-design-career) to structure the eLearning content in a learner-friendly manner. You need a graphic designer to make it pretty, and at least one eLearning developer dedicated to testing eLearning content to check for bugs. Each of these roles are filled by an expert in their field. You should take the time to identify the key strengths of your collaborators and then assign tasks accordingly.
## **4. Effective eLearning Project Management**

When you have so many creative people working together, tempers can flare and styles can clash. A good eLearning Project Manager will help all the different elements fit together. They also help to maintain timelines and resolve conflicts, as well as spot any hold-ups in the system and find a way to work past them. The [**eLearning Project Manager**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/elearning-project-management-and-planning-top-tips) has the duty of keeping everyone motivated. They need good communication skills and the ability to work well with others. The role of an eLearning Project Manager stretches into quality control, as well. They will monitor progress and tweak the system as necessary for optimal results.
## **5. eLearning Course Development Guidelines**

The content of any eLearning course has several subsets. The [**Instructional Designer**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/how-to-become-instructional-designer), with the help of a [**Subject Matter Expert**](https://elearningindustry.com/7-tips-find-right-subject-matter-expert-elearning-project), decides what the eLearning course is about and what exactly will go into it. They decide what topics will be taught, how many modules there will be, and how it will be broken down. Then an eLearning content author takes all that course material and puts it in written form. They write the actual text that will go into the eLearning course, as well as the script for the narrative sections. After that's wrapped up, the Instructional Designer reviews the eLearning content to ensure that it’s clear and concise. A storyboard is developed, and eLearning developers create and test the eLearning course based on it. This is teamwork. Everyone needs to be able to follow pre-determined eLearning course development guidelines to stay on track. This process also upholds the continuity of the eLearning content so that online learners receive a cohesive eLearning course that's fragment-free.
## **6. Purpose-Driven Visual Design**

Visual design handles the final look and feel of the eLearning course. It covers illustrations and graphics, but it also deals with page layout, choice of color, and font type. The graphic design team may include photographers, sketch artists, graphic designers, and even web developers. Especially, in the case of [**gamification**](https://elearningindustry.com/tags/gamification-examples), visual design is very important because it’s the first thing online learners notice about an eLearning course. Besides [**setting the right tone**](https://elearningindustry.com/tips-choose-right-tone-for-elearning), it can inspire, encourage, or demoralize an online learner. A strong visual design team is the basis of any eLearning course.

eLearning teams cover a wide range of expertise, and each area of expertise is essential to the success of the eLearning course. Mandatory team members include Instructional Designers, eLearning content developers, graphic artists, eLearning course developers, QA testers, and administrative personnel, under the supervision of an [**eLearning Project Manager**](https://elearningindustry.com/free-ebooks/elearning-project-management-and-planning-top-tips), who is the go-to person in any particular situation. These team members need to work together to facilitate the smooth flow of the eLearning project.
