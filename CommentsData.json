Nutrition, deficiency of nutrition and Balanced diet\n\n3. An important topic was also covered with the context of women/girls, that was about  the **anemia, menstruation cycle, hygiene during periods and myths about periods in our society. ** \n\n**Feedback from students-: ** Before  this session I tried to talk about this with girls and I got to know that they are unaware about the menstruation cycle, why it happen with them/only with girls. That time I also found hesitation in them. some of them started smiling.   \n\nAfter the session girls said that they got to know about their  body, importance and process of menstruation cycle, hygiene during periods time & myths about periods in our society.\n\n1.
