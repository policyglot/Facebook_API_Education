I think instead of convincing, it would be good to make her realise her abilities and interest and help her make a decision.   Since you mentioned, she is desperately wants a job in the same trade, it shows her interest to pursue the career in same line.  She might not have technical abilities, which she need to work on.  Once she builds her technical aptitude with her present good communication skills, she might get a good opportunity in the same trade.  Academic performance hardly matters in an interview scenario.

That's one source of ideas, but not the best. If you look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in imitation of some other startup. Where did they get their ideas? Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.\n\nApple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer, Google because Larry and Sergey couldn't find stuff online, Hotmail because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn't exchange email at work.\n\nSo Instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction. Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might solve them.",

Even companies you think of as having one founder, like Oracle, usually turn out to have more. It seems unlikely this is a coincidence.\n\nWhat's wrong with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote of no confidence. It probably means the founder couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That's pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.\n\nBut even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage. Starting a startup is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.\n\nThe last one might be the most important. The low points in a startup are so low that few could bear them alone. When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to violate conservation laws. Each thinks \"I can't let my friends down.\" This is one of the most powerful forces in human nature, and it's missing when there's just one founder.",

Gottlieb said this research would greatly increase your chances of success, because most companies have made common mistakes that have led to their demise. He said that having the humility to learn from the mistakes of others before making them yourself is the secret to success.\n\n**Make sure this is what you want.** Because entrepreneurship entails so much hard work, it is critical to ensure you're following the right path,\n\n\"If this is something you really want, then think long term, and be persistent,\" she said. \"The vast majority of great entrepreneurs failed multiple times before they finally found the business idea that took off and brought them success.\"\n\n**Solve problems.** Entrepreneurs should always be in search of problems to solve and not the other way around, . In other words, \"they should not start with a solution looking for a problem,\" he said.\n\n**Be passionate.** Successful entrepreneurs are driven primarily by a need for achievement and the desire to make a meaningful difference, Bachenheimer said. \"The most important traits are passion and persistence, but these must not be confused with arrogance and stubbornness,\" he said.\n\n**Get advice from those who have done it.**  business owners to find mentors who are successful, in addition to reading books, networking with people they admire and looking into great education programs to help them throughout the process.",

Indira Nooyi and Satya Nadella were both educated in India and spent their formative years in India.

This is a great example of how we need to check facts from multiple sources when information is freely available on the internet. This is also not a skill that we are taught in schools :)",

Nutrition, deficiency of nutrition and Balanced diet\n\n3. An important topic was also covered with the context of women/girls, that was about  the **anemia, menstruation cycle, hygiene during periods and myths about periods in our society. ** \n\n**Feedback from students-: ** Before  this session I tried to talk about this with girls and I got to know that they are unaware about the menstruation cycle, why it happen with them/only with girls. That time I also found hesitation in them. some of them started smiling.   \n\nAfter the session girls said that they got to know about their  body, importance and process of menstruation cycle, hygiene during periods time & myths about periods in our society.\n\n1.  (aaj se phle itna apne shareer ke bare me nhi janti thi jo aaj class me jan ne ko mila)\n\n2.Gender ke bare me janko mila jo hame pata hona chahiye.\n\n\"And the best part was that distributed sticky notes to all so that they can write easily.
